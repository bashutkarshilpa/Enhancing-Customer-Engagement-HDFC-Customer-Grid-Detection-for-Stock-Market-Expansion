# HDFC Revenue Grid Prediction

## Overview
HDFC, a leading bank, is venturing into the stock brokerage business and aims to attract existing customers to its new platform by offering additional benefits. As data scientists, our task is to predict the Revenue Grid, which determines the revenue class of customers. To achieve this, we have built several machine learning models including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. Notably, we attained an impressive accuracy of 96.1% with both gradient boosting and random forest models.

## Objectives
- Predict the Revenue Grid of HDFC bank customers to determine their revenue class.
- Assist HDFC in targeting customers effectively by offering tailored benefits to different revenue classes.
- Optimize customer engagement and conversion rates for the new stock brokerage platform.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gathered customer data including demographics, transaction history, and interactions.
- Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Engineered informative features related to customer behavior, banking activities, and potential interest in stock market investments.

### 3. Model Development
- Implemented machine learning models including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting to predict the Revenue Grid.
- Trained and fine-tuned the models using the preprocessed data to optimize performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected the best-performing model for deployment based on evaluation results, achieving a remarkable 96.1% accuracy with both gradient boosting and random forest models.

## Result
After building and evaluating multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, we have successfully predicted the Revenue Grid for HDFC bank customers. This predictive capability enables HDFC to target customers effectively with personalized benefits, driving engagement and revenue growth for the new stock brokerage platform.
